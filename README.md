# OpenD - a Web3.0 NFT marketplace built on IC blockchain

## Introduction
This is a code repository for a NFT marketplace, which allows for minting, listing and selling non-funglible tokens on ICP. Similar to other such websites, like OpenSea, it includes (among others): 
- token contract development
- NFT minting, buying and selling logic
- old-school simple design

Thank you AppBrewery and Angela Yu for teaching me this.
